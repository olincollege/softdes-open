# Assignment 6: Software Architecture Design

This assignment is intended to help you practice designing a software
architecture for a larger code base. In some ways, the goal of this assignment
is to prepare you for the final project in this course, walking you through the
process of designing a multi-component software project. Specifically, you will
be building on your design from the previous assignment to implement a game of
tic-tac-toe.

To ensure that the code you run in this notebook uses the latest version of your
code, run the following cell each time you start or restart your notebook:

```{python}
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

## 0. Design

Your main task in this assignment is to implement a playable version of
tic-tac-toe using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which you should
have seen in
[Reading 6](https://softdes.olin.edu/docs/readings/6-software-architecture-design/#the-model-view-controller-pattern).
As the name suggests, the final product will consist of objects representing the
model, the view, and the controller, as well as a function to tie all of these
together to run the game.

![MVC interactions](static/mvc.png)

The _model_ represents the current state of the game, as well as the ways in
which the game can be interacted with. In tic-tac-toe, the state of the game is
the set of moves that have been made so far, as well as which player is the next
to move. The ways of interacting with the game including marking a square,
checking whether a player has won, etc.If you completed Assignment 5, you have
already written implemented the model for the game. Even if you did not, an
implementation of the model is available for you to use in
`tic_tac_toe_board.py`.

The _view_ is a representation of the model. In tic-tac-toe, the state of the
game is just the board squares and whose turn it is (i.e., the next player to
move), so the view is responsible for displaying these two pieces of
information. Your first task in this assignment will be to implement a view.

The _controller_ provides a user interface for interacting with the model. In
tic-tac-toe, a controller represents a player. It takes some input, such as
typed text from the user, and converts this into an action like marking a square
(which can be done with through the method provided by the model). In this
assignment, you have the task of implementing a controllers that takes typed
text input from the user.

Finally, you will tie everything together using a function to set up and run a
game of tic-tac-toe.

## 1. An Inherited View (and an Acquired Taste)

For the purposes of this assignment, you will only be creating a single view of
tic-tac-toe, which represents the game in text form. To keep your design
extensible in the future, it can be helpful to structure your view in two parts:
a class that defines the methods that you can use to view the game, and a
subclass that actually implements those methods. This is helpful because any
kind of view (text, graphical, etc.) of a game of tic-tac-toe will use the same
set of methods to display the game, making it easy to swap them out later.

Some starter code for implementing the view is in `tic_tac_toe_view.py`. You may
find it helpful to have the code visible as you read the problem description
below.

### 1.1. As Easy as `abc`

![The Jackson 5 - ABC](static/abc.png)

No, not that.

The first part of writing a view is to create an _abstract base class_. The
purpose of this class is to do some setup that is common to any view, as well as
define the methods that need to be implemented to have a working view of the
game. This class is called _abstract_ because you cannot create an instance of
it directly - the only way to use this class is to define a subclass that
inherits from it, and then create an instance of the subclass.

The [`abc` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) in the Python
standard library provides a class called `ABC` that can be used to create an
abstract base class. To do this, you need to declare a class that inherits from
`ABC`, as you can see in the `TicTacToeView` class of `tic_tac_toe_view.py`.

For this part, you need to write three methods in `TicTacToeView`:

- An `__init__` method that takes an instance of a `TicTacToeBoard` as a
  parameter and stores it as a private instance attribute.
- A `board` property that returns the tic-tac-toe board stored in the
  `TicTacToeView` instance. (Remember that you can use the `@property` decorator
  from Assignment 5 to do this.)
- A `draw` method that is an abstract method (see below) that does nothing
  (i.e., you can write `pass` as the body of the function).

To declare an abstract method, you can use the `@abstractmethod` decorator, like
this:

```python
@abstractmethod
def foo(self):
    pass
```

You won't be able to easily test your code at this point, so once you have done
this part, you can move onto the next part and test your code after that.

### 1.2. A More Concrete View

![Actual concrete](static/concrete.jpg)

No, not that.

Now you need to create a class that concretely implements the view of the
abstract view interface you created in the previous part. Essentially, you can
do this by writing a new class `TextView` that inherits from `TicTacToeView`.
Because `TextView` is a subclass of `TicTacToeView`, it gets all of the
attributes and methods of `TicTacToeView` automatically. Because `TicTacToeView`
is an abstract class, the subclass `TextView` needs to override the `draw`
method before you can create an instance of `TextView`.

In the `TextView` class, implement the `draw` method, which should print the
board, followed by a string stating whose turn it is. The string should be in
the form `It is now X's turn.`. As an example, the `draw` method might print
something like this:

```
+-+-+-+
|O| | |
+-+-+-+
| |X| |
+-+-+-+
|X| | |
+-+-+-+
It is now O's turn.
```

Once you have completed this problem, you should be able to see the above view
by running the following code cell. (Note that your code also needs to pass the
unit tests.)

```{python}
from tic_tac_toe_board import TicTacToeBoard
from tic_tac_toe_view import TextView

board = TicTacToeBoard()
view = TextView(board)
board.mark(1, 1)
board.mark(0, 0)
board.mark(2, 0)
view.draw()
```

## 2. Taking Control

The next step is to implement a controller for the game. The
`tic_tac_toe_controller.py` file contains two classes, `TicTacToeController` and
`TextController`.

Implement `TicTacToeController` in the same way that you write `TicTacToeView`.
Properly implemented, `TicTacToeController` should be identical to
`TicTacToeView`, except that it has an abstract method called `move` instead of
one called `draw`.

Then, implement `TextController` to override the `move` method. The
`TextController` class only contains the `move` method, and this method should
get input from the user and make an appropriate move on the board. The user's
input is expected to be in the form `0 1`, where the first number represents the
row of the board to mark and the second number represents the column. In this
example `0 1` should try to mark row 0, column 1, which is the top center square
of the board.

You can get input from the user with the built-in
[`input` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input). This
function displays a prompt to the user and stores the entered text in a string.
If you run the following cell, you should see a box you can enter text in. If
you then enter some text and press enter, the code will report back what you
entered.

```{python}
text = input("Type some text here: ")
print(f"You entered the following:\n{text}")
```

The `move` method should get this input and process it to obtain a row and
column index, and then attempt to mark that square of the board using the `mark`
method of the `TicTacToeBoard` class. The `move` method does not return
anything, and should call the `mark` method.

There are a few ways that processing user input can fail: the user might input
only one integer, or some other text than an integer (e.g., `foo`), or the
square may already have a mark in it. If this happens, your `move` method should
prompt the user for input again, repeating this process until the user inputs a
valid move.

To handle these cases, you should use a _try-except block_, which looks like
this:

```{python}
try:
    number = input("Type an integer here: ")
    x = int(number)
except ValueError:
    print(f"Error: '{number}' is not an integer")
```

If you run this block, you can type some text in, and if you type an integer
like `42`, then the value of `x` will the integer you entered. If not, you will
see an error message printed.

The block works by trying to execute some lines of Python, and if a certain
error occurs (`ValueError` in the example above), it will stop and instead
execute some other code.

If your `move` method is properly implemented, invalid user input will produce
only one of two errors: `IndexError` or `ValueError`. To handle multiple error
types, you can write the try-except block like this);

```python
try:
    # Get user input and process it here.
except (IndexError, ValueError):
    # Handle the error here.
```

One clever trick you can use to detect invalid user input is to do some checking
in the `try` portion of your block, and raise an error if you find an issue. For
example, you could do this (as a hypothetical example):

```python
try:
    if x < 0:
        raise ValueError
except (IndexError, ValueError):
    # Handle the error here.
```

This allows you to quickly jump to the error section if you find invalid input,
even if it would not otherwise cause an error.

If your processing encounters an error, you should print a short error message
and get user input again. A simple way of doing this is to call `move` again,
but you are free to do this however you choose.

Once you have completed this problem, you should be able to run the code cell
below to input a move and see it reflected on the board.

```{python}
from tic_tac_toe_controller import TextController
from tic_tac_toe_board import TicTacToeBoard

board = TicTacToeBoard()
controller = TextController(board)
controller.move()
print(board)
```

## 3. All Together Now

Once you have all of your MVC components, you're ready to put it all together.
The `tic_tac_toe_game.py` file contains a function called `main` that you should
implement to set up and run your game of tic-tac-toe.

In order, your `main` function should do the following:

1. Create a `TicTacToeBoard` instance to represent the game board.
2. Create a `TextView` instance and two `TextControllers` instances to represent
   the view and controllers for the board, respectively.
3. (optional) Set up any other variables that may be helpful in running the
   game.
4. Run the game, getting moves from each player until either one player has won,
   or until the board is full.
5. Print a short message stating who won or that the game was a draw, and exit
   (by letting the function end).

You _must_ create two `TextController` instances. While it is possible to run
the game with only a single controller, creating separate controllers for `X`
and `O` allows you to swap out a single player's controller in the future (for
example, if you write an AI controller and want to play against it).

Other than that, how you set up and run your game is completely up to you. Feel
free to chat with a CA or instructor for help in thinking through your design.

Once you have completed this problem, you should be able to run
`python tic_tac_toe_game.py` from your terminal and play a game of tic-tac-toe!
(You'll have to play both sides, or find a friends to play against.)
Congratulations! You've just written a complete, playable game in Python.
